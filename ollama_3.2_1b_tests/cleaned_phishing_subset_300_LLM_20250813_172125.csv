As programmers weve been able to make our lives complicated for at least half a century the hardware interrupt gives us the rope. Part of Dijkstras inspiration for THE was the counterexample of IBMs multi- programmed boxes were these the same ones that inspired Mythical Man Month and I suppose he would say the question is how not to make a mess of it -- how should we structure computations so if we try to do ten times as many things at the same time reasoning about the resulting system is at most ten times more complex -- not one hundred and certainly not three and a half million times more.

"FROM: John Gay SUBJECT: ILUG Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2 EMAIL: A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself so I asked on another list and got a few answers most were ""dont even think about it"" but a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch. After having a good search around the lfs site Ive decided Im going to give it a whirl. Ive got a spare box and loads of free time so why not - The lfs site however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or GlibC A quick google found PGCC a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC but the site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time So my general plan and Im taking my time with this: Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions / /usr /var and /home. Install a base Debian system into the /home partition so I can build the rest of the system into the other partitions. Using Debian build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. Ill try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage. chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs. strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot from / rather than /home then move /home to its proper partition. All going well I should now have a full base Linux system running that is fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC. Now I can build zlib and then X again optimizing. And I can follow this with the various graphics libs qt lib and finally KDE. If all goes well I will probably repeate this for my Dual system once I can find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Ive got. I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.

Theres a bigger issue with trying to make whatever repr does a codec in Py3k. As a Unicode->Unicode transformation it doesnt mesh well with Py3ks strict Unicode->bytes/bytes->Unicode encoding/decoding philosophy. That said it would be nice to have a way to easily stack Unicode->Unicode transforms on top of text IO streams or byte->byte transforms on top of binary streams.

The URI analyzer already is smarter Changing the URICountry plugin is the way to fix this. The Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/URIDetail plugin is a good example of how plugins can get metadata about the URIs via the get_uri_detail_list API. looking at the POD doc and source for that in Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus I see that ""types"" ""parsed"" should mean that the URI was inferred instead of found in a link or image.

Personally I would consider the following sufficient: 1 people who have authenticated themselves against the underlying VCS i.e. project members may post public comments and comment on other comments 2 anonymous users can post comments that wont become publicly visible until an authenticated user acknowledges them or comments on them. That should be enough to keep the system open to everybody and to keep spam away. >> Of >> course any such alternative would probably also require an account and >> Terms of Service agreement. > > Youre seeing this to strictly.

SUBJECT: UAI Book Announcement: Modelling and Reasoning with Vague Concepts - by J. Lawry EMAIL: Modelling and Reasoning with Vague Concepts by Jonathan Lawry Published by Springer Overview Vagueness is central to the flexibility and robustness of natural language descriptions. Vague concepts are robust to the imprecision of our perceptions while still allowing us to convey useful and sometimes vital information. The study of vagueness in Artificial Intelligence AI is therefore motivated by the desire to incorporate this robustness and flexibility into intelligent computer systems. Such a goal however requires a formal model of vague concepts that will allow us to quantify and manipulate the uncertainty resulting from their use as a means of passing information between autonomous agents. This volume outlines a formal representation framework for modelling and reasoning with vague concepts in Artificial Intelligence. The new calculus has many applications especially in automated reasoning learning data analysis and information fusion. This book gives a rigorous introduction to label semantics theory illustrated with many examples and suggests clear operational interpretations of the proposed measures. It also provides a detailed description of how the theory can be applied in data analysis and information fusion based on a range of benchmark problems. Contents Foreword - by Didier Dubois Chapter 1:Introduction Chapter 2: Vague Concepts and Fuzzy Sets Chapter 3: Label Semantics Chapter 4: Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Instance Label Semantics Chapter 5: Information from Vague Concepts Chapter 6: Learning Linguistic Models from Data Chapter 7: Fusing Knowledge and Data Chapter 8: Non-Additive Appropriateness Measures The book can be ordered from the Springer website: http://www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0118554-175-22-86707466-details Page253Dppmmedia257Ctoc257Ctoc00.html,Legit,False,Low,[],"[""Verify sender's authenticity by contacting the institution directly.""]","Legitimate, appears to be a genuine announcement from an academic publisher."

I can add new ones to existing bookmarks and they are created normally but then I cant edit them either on the bookmark page itself or from the rename/ delete forms. I also cant remove a tag from an existing bookmark however bundling tags seems to work fine. Ive tried changing them on both Mac and PC in Safari FF old mac IE 5.5 and Opera 9 on Mac and FF 2.0.0.2 and 2.5 IE7 and Opera 9.2 on Win XP Home and Win 2000 Professional. I get a confirmation that its done whatever it was supposed to but no changes are actually made. I put in a support request but never heard anything back one way or the other. However its not an intermittent problem its been going on for at least a week and a half. I was able to make changes before that.

SUBJECT: Culture the Arts and the State in New Zealand in the Wake of Neoliberalism: EMAIL: Seminar tomorrow Culture the Arts and the State in New Zealand in the Wake of Neoliberalism Jenny Lawn Social and Cultural Studies In this seminar I will outline an ongoing research project that I am undertaking in collaboration with Prof. Mark Williams of the University of Canterbury. Drawing on case studies from New Zealand literature and literary infrastructure we are pursuing the view that neoliberalism and cultural reinvention including biculturalism are deeply implicated in each other. The study is proceeding along three inter-related strands of inquiry: 1. The impact of cultural policy: A discussion of the ways in which governments have employed cultural policy to shape national consciousness during this period. 2. Literary form and reception: Analysis of selected authors whose writing and the placing of that writing within a national context have been particularly shaped by the conditions of neoliberalism. 3. The mobilisation of culture: Here we trace some of the ways in which the term culture has tended to sideline the term society in debates about how literature relates to the wider world. The aim of the seminar is to survey the conceptual challenges methodology and structure of the project. See you there Wed. 5 March 4:00 pm AT 3.49.

Its just that Im basically lazy and it seemed far easier for me simply to take all my non-spam folders and copy them together into one big temporary file run sa-learn on it and then delete the temporary file eg: /bin/bash cat /mail/mailinglists/ /mail/WorkStuff/ /mail/Admin/ > TempHam sa-learn --ham --mbox /mail/TempHam rm /mail/TempHam Im no bash-scripting wiz that much should be obvious so I could think of no easy way to strip only todays mails out of my 20-odd folders and just feed those to sa-learn. My way I need to do nothing myself the job takes about half an hour and Im asleep when it happens... OK sa-learn has to work a bit harder than it needs to but hey better it than me The 180 days thing is because I choose to keep only the last 6 months approx mail in each of my 20 or so folders the rest being zipped into a gzip archive using ""Archivemail"" a very neat little utility btw and 180 days is its default setting see I told you I was lazy. > Let sa-learn complete and then chop the folder.

SUBJECT: Astrology.com: Cosmic Calendar EMAIL: Difficulties reading this email You can also check your Daily Cosmic Calendar by clicking here. Please add cosmiccalendar@rp.astrology.com to your address book to ensure that your newsletters are delivered correctly. Wednesday August 6 As suggested in yesterdays calendar entry today is potentially a real shocker mixed with plenty of uncertainty. First of all four challenging sky patterns from yesterday involving the Sun Mercury Venus Jupiter Uranus and Pluto are still impacting on humanity and Planet Earth. Now we are adding the following: Mars contra-parallel to Uranus 7:55AM PDT Mars in Virgo opposite to Uranus in Pisces 11:38AM PDT Mercury in Leo opposite to Neptune in Aquarius 11:41AM PDT Pallas in Gemini square to Venus in Virgo 4:53PM PDT. The Mars-Uranus contra-parallel is really a harbinger of their zodiacal polarity happening a few hours later. The Mars-Uranus encounter can manifest as vocal fireworks between associates and family members. Tone down your rhetoric and steer clear of angry outbursts. Instability and surprises are now the rule rather than the exception in key relationships. Meanwhile confusion and nebulosity grow in partnerships as Mercury makes its annual opposition with Neptune. While this can be a good alignment for creative undertakings in film photography music dance and spiritual studies you definitely want to take a rain check when it comes to legal contracts signings and long-term commitments. The Venus-Pallas face-off can equate with poor judgments and only partially successful problem-solving. On the other hand you may still have potent brainstorms and strategy sessions by staying on message and using plenty of commonsense. Libra Moon continues to emphasize the importance of resolving relationship disputes with sensitivity and respect. Dont forget that Junos presence looms large on the psychic landscape as this asteroid is poised to shift from reverse to forward on Friday morning.

Given the number of issues 2to3 cant fix because it would be too dangerous to guess I certainly cant imagine a just-in-time porting solution that would work reliably. Making two releases means I can migrate once and only once and be done with it. Making a single release work on 2.x and 3.x means I have to keep all of the details of both Python 2 and 3 in my head all the time as I code not to mention litter my codebase with "" the following ugly hack lets us work with Python 2 and 3"" comments so someone else doesnt undo all my hard work when they run the tests on Python 3 but not 2 No thanks.

SUBJECT: UAI CFP: Special Issue on random sets and imprecise probabilities EMAIL: CALL FOR PAPERS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING Special Issue on RANDOM SETS AND IMPRECISE PROBABILITIES Random sets or measurable multi-valued mappings constitute a powerful generalisation of random variables with applications on areas as diverse as economics data mining or environmental sciences. On the other hand imprecise probability models have arisen in the last years as a powerful alternative to classical probability for situations when imprecision or vagueness prevents the use of a precise and unique probability distribution with certain guarantees. This special issue is meant to cover the several connections existing between random sets and imprecise probabilities. Foundational issues on this topic include but are not limited to upper and lower probabilities capacities induced by random sets sets of measurable selections upper and lower integrals of random sets and coarse data analysis. Applications of random sets and imprecise probabilities in Computer Science Economics Social Sciences or Information Technology are also welcome. Authors should submit their papers electronically to both special issue editors. The papers must contain original unpublished work that is not being submitted for publication elsewhere. Due to limitations of space only papers with less than 20 pages will be considered. Manuscripts submitted to this special issue should follow the format guidelines that can be found at http://www.elsevier.com/locate/ijar and will be refereed according to the standard procedures for International Journal of Approximate Reasoning. The DEADLINE for submissions is May 15 2006. The issue is expected to be ready by early 2007. Electronic submission is required.
